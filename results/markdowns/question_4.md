|               | Based on the provided information, there are two new requirements for penetration testing in PCI DSS version 4.0. Firstly, the penetration testing methodology must include industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter, and testing from both inside and outside the network. Secondly, the assessment must examine the scope of work and results from the most recent external penetration test to ensure that penetration testing is performed according to all elements specified in this requirement. Additionally, the assessor must interview personnel to verify that the external penetration test was performed by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third-party and that organizational independence of the tester exists. |

Coverage of the entire CDE perimeter and critical systems: Penetration testing should cover the entire perimeter of the CDE, including firewalls, routers, switches, and other network devices, as well as critical systems such as databases, servers, and applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|               | 3. Testing from both inside and outside the network: Penetration testing should involve testing from both inside and outside the network to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities that may not be visible from within the network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|               | 4. Validating segmentation and scope-reduction controls: Penetration testing should also validate the effectiveness of segmentation and scope-reduction controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|               | 5. Identifying vulnerabilities in application layers: Penetration testing should include testing of application layers to identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|               | 6. Correction of identified vulnerabilities: Once vulnerabilities are identified through penetration testing, they must be corrected promptly to minimize the risk of attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|               | By understanding the importance of penetration testing in PCI DSS compliance, organizations can take proactive steps to protect their systems and networks from cyber threats and maintain the trust of their customers and stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|               | Sí, puedo dar más detalles sobre las prácticas de prueba de penetración en PCI DSS. La PCI DSS requiere que se realice un penetration testing externo al menos una vez cada 12 meses y después de cualquier modificación o cambio significativo en la infraestructura o el software. El penetration testing debe ser realizado por un recurso interno calificado o un tercero de fuera de la organización calificado y debe cumplir con la metodología definida por la entidad. Además, las vulnerabilidades y debilidades de seguridad que se encuentren durante el penetration testing deben ser corregidas y verificadas mediante la repetición del testing.                                                                                                                                     |
| Orca-2-7b     | **What are some best practices for conducting effective penetration tests?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|               | Some best practices for conducting effective penetration tests include performing the testing according to a defined methodology, ensuring the tester has organizational independence, validating segmentation and scope reduction controls, testing both inside and outside the network, considering the latest threats and vulnerabilities, and documenting the approach to addressing risks identified during the testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
