      " Some best practices for conducting effective penetration tests include performing the testing according to the entity's defined methodology, ensuring the test is conducted at least once every 12 months after significant infrastructure or application changes, using a qualified internal resource or external third-party tester who maintains organizational independence, and considering the latest threats and vulnerabilities experienced in the past year. Additionally, it is important to perform testing from both inside and outside the network, validate segmentation and scope reduction controls, and apply application and network-layer testing. Finally, documenting the approach to assessing and addressing risks posed by exploitable vulnerabilities and security weaknesses found during penetration testing and retaining the results and remediation activities for at least 12 months can help improve the effectiveness of these tests.\n",
