Firstly, the penetration testing methodology must include industry-accepted penetration testing approaches, coverage for the entire CDE perimeter, and testing from both inside and outside the network. Secondly, the assessment must examine the scope of work and results from the most recent external penetration test to ensure that penetration testing is performed according to all elements specified in this requirement. Additionally, the assessor must interview personnel to verify that the external penetration test was performed by a qualified internal resource or qualified external third-party and that organizational independence of the tester exists.\n",
