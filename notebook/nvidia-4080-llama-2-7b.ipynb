      "Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments are both important components of PCI DSS compliance, but they serve different purposes and have distinct methodologies.\n",
      "Penetration testing involves simulating a cyber attack on an organization's network, systems, and applications to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. This type of testing is focused on identifying potential threats and weaknesses in the system, rather than simply identifying vulnerabilities. The goal of penetration testing is to provide recommendations for improving security posture and reducing the likelihood of a successful attack.\n",
      "Vulnerability assessments, on the other hand, involve identifying and classifying potential vulnerabilities in the system based on industry standards and best practices. This type of assessment is focused on identifying potential weaknesses in the system and prioritizing remediation efforts based on risk. Vulnerability assessments typically use automated tools to scan the system for known vulnerabilities and may also include manual testing to identify additional vulnerabilities.\n",
      "In summary, penetration testing is a more comprehensive and proactive approach to identifying security threats, while vulnerability assessments are a more reactive approach to identifying potential vulnerabilities. Both are important components of PCI DSS compliance and should be conducted regularly to ensure the security of cardholder data.\n",

Social engineers may use various tactics such as phishing emails, phone calls, or physical interactions to obtain information.\n",
